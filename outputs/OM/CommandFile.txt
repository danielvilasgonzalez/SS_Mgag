FORMAT
Coma delimited Parameter file for EcospaceConsole.
Lines that do not start with a recognised TAG will be ignored.
Recognized TAG's need to be braced with a closing and opening angle brackets
If an expected TAG is not found, it was missing or there is a typo, the varible will be left at the database value and a waring will be written to the console window.
The first three columns contain data in the format, TAG, Value, Variable Type, comments can be added in the forth column.

<ECOSPACE_SCENARIO_INDEX>, 1, System.Int32
<ECOSIM_SCENARIO_INDEX>, 2, System.Int32
<SPATIAL_ENABLED>, True, System.Boolean, Use the spatial temporal framework
<ECOSPACE_USE_IBM>, True, System.Boolean
<ECOSPACE_USE_MULTISTANZA>, False, System.Boolean
Output and saving
<ECOSPACE_USE_CORE_OUPUT_DIR>, False, System.Boolean
<ECOSPACE_USE_ANNUAL_OUTPUT>, False, System.Boolean, Output monthly maps and spatially averaged .csv files
<ECOSPACE_OUTPUT_DIR>, C:/WFS EwE/age structure ecospace/outputs/, System.String
<ECOSPACE_SAVE_AVERAGED_BIOMASS>, True, System.Boolean, Save the spatially averaged biomass .csv file (time series)
<ECOSPACE_SAVE_MAP_BIOMASS>, True, System.Boolean
<MO_SAVE_MAP_BIOMASS>, False, System.Boolean
<ECOSPACE_FIRST_OUTPUT_TIMESTEP>, 1, System.Int32
ECOSPACE_ENVIRONMENTAL_RESPONSE format  eShapeFunctionType 1-11, Shape index from the Ecospace environmental responses interface, Function parameters from the Change Shape dialogue(in the same order as they appear in the UI grid)
<ECOSPACE_ENVIRONMENTAL_RESPONSE_STRING>, , System.String
<ECOSPACE_USE_SPINUP>, True, System.Boolean
<ECOSPACE_SPINUP_LENGTH>, 2, System.Int32
Eco Indicators Plugin Config
<ECOINDICATORS_SAVE_ECOSPACE>, False, System.Boolean, True will save all the indicators to file. There is no fine grained manipulation of variable
<ECOINDICATORS_SAVE_ANNUAL>, False, System.Boolean, True will save annual file only. These are not the annually averaged values, it's a single value taken from the 12 month of the year. 
Ecospace Dispersal and Vulnerabilities
ECOSPACE_DISPERSAL_RATE array of dispersal rates in group order. There is no group index, it assumes they are in the same order as the groups.
        If the array has fewer values than the groups it will just set the dispersal rates for part of the groups.
//<ECOSPACE_DISPERSAL_RATE>,  300 300 300 300 300 300 300 50 50 500 100 10 10 300 300 1, System.Single[]
ECOSIM_VULNERABILITIES_BY_PRED Sets the vulnerability multiplier for a predator/column in the vulnerabilities grid.
        Format Predator_group_index vulnerability e.g. 1 999 would set all the vulnerabilities for predator group 1 to 999
        Can be use to clear out existing vulnerabilities before setting individual values by prey pred index
ECOSIM_VULNERABILITIES_BY_PREY_PRED Sets vulnerabilities for a single prey and predator, prey index first
        Format prey index first then predator then vulnerability  e.g. 10 1 999 would set the vulnerabilities of group 10 to predator group 1 to 999
//<ECOSIM_VULNERABILITIES_BY_PREY_PRED>, , System.Single[]
IBM Threading 
N_IBM_MOVEMENT_THREADS number of threads to run the IBM movement on. This will default to number of cores on the system.
<N_IBM_MOVEMENT_THREADS>,8, System.Int32, number of thread to run IBM movement on
ECOSPACE_SAVE_THREAD_LOG Save the thread timing log in the same directory as the model. This will be the model name with _log_ThreadTiming.txt appended.
<ECOSPACE_SAVE_THREAD_LOG>,True, System.Boolean
<IBM_SAVE_AGE_STRUCTURE>, True, System.Boolean, True to save the IBM age structure file
